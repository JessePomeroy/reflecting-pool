/**
 * Universal admin mutation proxy.
 *
 * The browser Convex WebSocket in this app is intentionally unauthenticated
 * (see `src/routes/admin/+layout.svelte` for why — `createSvelteAuthClient`
 * has a WebSocket-pause bug on SvelteKit client-side nav under
 * `better-auth@1.5.x`). Without auth on the socket, every admin mutation
 * fails on the backend's `requireAuth`/`requireSiteAdmin` checks.
 *
 * This endpoint bridges the gap: the admin-dashboard package's
 * `useAdminClient()` (when its `mutationTransport` is `"http"`) forwards
 * every `client.mutation(...)` call here as `POST { name, args }`. We
 * validate the Better Auth cookie, attach the token to a *fresh* Convex
 * HTTP client (not the process-wide singleton — avoids `setAuth` races
 * between concurrent requests), and forward the call. The mutation then
 * runs inside Convex with the caller's identity, as if the WebSocket had
 * been authenticated.
 *
 * Security posture:
 *   - We blind-forward any `name` the client sends — but Convex itself
 *     still enforces `requireAuth`/`requireSiteAdmin` on the forwarded
 *     call, so this does not grant extra permissions. Any mutation the
 *     user could have called over an authenticated WebSocket they can
 *     call here, and only those.
 *   - `requireAuth()` rejects stale/forged tokens via `adminAuth.whoami`
 *     *before* we attach the token to the HTTP client, so unauthenticated
 *     callers 401 out with no Convex round-trip for the mutation itself.
 *
 * Error shape: `{ error: string }` with a non-200 status. The
 * `useAdminClient` proxy throws `new Error(error)` on the consumer side,
 * matching the shape that Convex's WebSocket mutations throw.
